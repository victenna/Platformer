Python Pygame Mini Project. We present simple platformer game created with Pygame library. Using keyboard control buttons 
you keep moving your Mario (right or left) or upwards by jumping on the available platforms. Program uses collision function
for detecting collision between platform and Mario. If a collision is detected code locates Mario position at the top of
platform and prevents character from falling through it. If you miss a platform Mario fall down to the ground level. Code uses 
time recorder and after certain time game is over and code logic shows the number of platforms Mario reached. Such algorithm 
can be used as a part of the more sofisticated scenario, for example, for platformer game with different game environment.
Files for modeling this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
